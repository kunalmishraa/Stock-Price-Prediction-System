# Stock Price Prediction System

## Overview

The **Stock Price Prediction System** is a web application that leverages machine learning algorithms to predict future stock prices based on historical data. This project utilizes advanced data preprocessing techniques and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network to forecast stock prices, providing users with valuable insights into market trends.

## Features

- **User-Friendly Interface**: A clean and intuitive web interface allows users to input stock ticker symbols and retrieve predictions easily.
- **Stock Price Prediction**: Utilizes machine learning models to predict the future prices of stocks based on historical data.
- **Data Visualization**: Displays predicted and actual stock prices, enabling users to visualize the performance of their investments.
- **Preprocessing Module**: Includes a robust data preprocessing pipeline to prepare historical stock data for analysis.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS
- **Backend**: Python, Flask
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras (for LSTM model)
- **Data Handling**: Pandas, NumPy
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib

## Installation

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stock-price-prediction.git
   cd stock-price-prediction
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   python app.py
 
### Additional Notes
- Don't forget to replace `https://github.com/yourusername/stock-price-prediction.git` with the actual URL of your GitHub repository.
- You can also add sections for **Screenshots** or **Demo** if you want to showcase how your application looks and works.
