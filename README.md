##Stock Price Prediction System##
Overview
The Stock Price Prediction System is a web application that leverages machine learning algorithms to predict future stock prices based on historical data. This project utilizes advanced data preprocessing techniques and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network to forecast stock prices, providing users with valuable insights into market trends.

Features
User-Friendly Interface: A clean and intuitive web interface allows users to input stock ticker symbols and retrieve predictions easily.
Stock Price Prediction: Utilizes machine learning models to predict the future prices of stocks based on historical data.
Data Visualization: Displays predicted and actual stock prices, enabling users to visualize the performance of their investments.
Preprocessing Module: Includes a robust data preprocessing pipeline to prepare historical stock data for analysis.
Technologies Used
Frontend: HTML, CSS
Backend: Python, Flask
Machine Learning: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras (for LSTM model)
Data Handling: Pandas, NumPy
Visualization: Matplotlib
